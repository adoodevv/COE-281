# Programming and Problem Solving
This is a course taken in second year. I'd be saving all assignments and personal studies in this course here in this repository.

For Python, references, excercises and projects are from the **PYTHON CRASH COURSE** book by *ERIC MATTHES*

## Part II
This part of the book has projects in Game Development, Data visualization and Web Developoment.

I'll be building these projects in the Python_II folder
